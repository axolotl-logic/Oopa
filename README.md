Oopa is a password/wordlist analyser. It is highly modular, allowing users to write their own analyzers in Python with minimal effort. It supports user supports user-supplied encoding and output can be heavily customized.

Some of the modules were inspired by Pipal features, though the implementation differs drastically.

Consider this software so in Alpha stage that it's in Omega. In fact, you mine as well just go use Pipal (http://www.digininja.org/projects/pipal.php).
